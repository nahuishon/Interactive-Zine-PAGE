    <div class="pra">
    <p>Cabazon Dinosaurs, formerly Claude Bell's Dinosaurs, is a roadside attraction in Cabazon, California,
         featuring two enormous, steel-and-concrete dinosaurs named Dinny the Dinosaur and Mr. Rex. 
        Located just west of Palm Springs, the 150-foot-long (46 m) Brontosaurus and the 65-foot-tall (20 m) 
        Tyrannosaurus rex are visible from the freeway to travelers passing 
        by on Southern California's Interstate 10.[1] The roadside dinosaurs are best known for their appearance in the film 
        Pee-wee's Big Adventure (1985).</p>
